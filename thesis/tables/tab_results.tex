\begin{table}
\caption{This table shows the average speedup factor of the algorithms relative to Random Search across all benchmarks and repeated runs. Speedup factor indicates how much faster an algorithm finds a solution with the same objective function value as Random Search on full budget. A \SI{95}{\percent} confidence interval is provided for each speedup factor.}
